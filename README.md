### Alternative Assessment Question:
Entrepreneurship studies have seen significant success in the field of education over the past decades, being widely incorporated into many universities worldwide. This approach aims to nurture entrepreneurial competency among students, fostering the development of young entrepreneurs. However, the investigation into how the presence of entrepreneurship education influences students' entrepreneurial competency is still evolving. Questions arise about whether students in modern technical universities acquire entrepreneurial attitudes and competencies and whether they translate these competencies into entrepreneurial intentions. Entrepreneurial competencies result from multidimensional factors such as perseverance, initiative, competitiveness, self-reliance, a strong desire to achieve, self-confidence, good physical health, mental well-being, key traits, and more. Therefore, a critical examination of entrepreneurial attitudes and competencies among students is essential to identify potential factors influencing their development as successful entrepreneurs. To harness the potential of the Entrepreneurship dataset, the recommendation is to create a comprehensive dashboard framework for streamlined data visualization using tools like Power BI or Tableau.
